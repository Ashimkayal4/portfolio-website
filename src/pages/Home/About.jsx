                    Hi, Iâ€™m Ashim Kayal, a passionate Frontend Web Developer based in Bangladesh. I specialize in building beautiful and
                    user-friendly websites using modern web technologies like React, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript. With a deep interest in
                    UI/UX design and a strong foundation in development, I aim to create seamless digital experiences that are both
                    functional and visually appealing. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies or working on
                    creative projects.
